# Card Game: Ring of Fire
made by: Daniel Kolas, May 2022

## General info
This project was created as a favour for my friends. It is a simple card game called Ring of Fire, quite popular in America. The players are able to draw random cards from the deck. Each card has a different meaning and the players must do a certan task depending on the card number. The design needs an update, however, I wanted to share my initial version as it is my first React application finished fully without any help.
